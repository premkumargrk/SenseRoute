🚏 SenseRoute
 -> An IoT-Powered Ecosystem for Safe Navigation and Transport Detection
 
🚶‍♂️ IoT-Based Assistive Devices for the Visually Impaired
SenseRoute enhances the navigation, safety, and independence of visually impaired individuals, especially in public transportation environments, through a set of integrated IoT-based assistive devices.

📦 System Overview
The system consists of three core components working together to provide real-time situational awareness and transport information:

🦯 Smart Cane

👓 Smart Glasses

🚌 Transport Detection System

🦯 Smart Cane
 - Equipped with ultrasonic sensors to detect ground-level obstacles like potholes and barriers.

 - Provides haptic feedback using vibration motors to alert the user of nearby hazards.

 - Contains an RFID reader to detect public transport via RFID tags placed on buses.

👓 Smart Glasses
 - Includes head-level ultrasonic sensors to detect overhead obstacles (e.g., signboards, tree branches).

 - Alerts the user via buzzer or vibration feedback, improving safety in complex environments.

 - Receives data from the smart cane over the ESP-NOW wireless protocol, ensuring low-latency communication.

🚌 Transport Detection System
 - RFID tags are placed on public transportation vehicles (e.g., buses).

 - The RFID reader embedded in the smart cane detects these tags.

 - Real-time transport info is transmitted wirelessly to the smart glasses, which provide audio feedback about the approaching vehicle.

 - Helps users identify and board public transport independently and on time.

🔗 Communication Architecture
 - Utilizes the ESP-NOW protocol for fast and energy-efficient wireless communication between the smart cane and smart glasses.

 - Designed for low-power operation and real-time responsiveness.
